# msba-skill-sprint-conradrare
SQL skill sprint using the Chinook database to practice queries and data analysis.

I chose SQL as my skill because it is a core tool for data analysis and is essential for working with structured data in real-world business settings.

SQL is valuable for my career because it enables me to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze data efficiently, helping support data-driven decision-making and business insights.
