# Implementation Plan

## What does this repo do?
This repository demonstrates how to use SQL to query and analyze data using the Chinook sample database. It shows how to retrieve data, filter results and summarize information using SQL queries.

## What to change to use it for a real company?
To apply this in a real company, the Chinook database would be replaced with actual business data. The SQL queries would be modified to answer real business questions such as customer trends, revenue analysis and performance tracking.
